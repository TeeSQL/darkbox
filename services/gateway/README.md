# @darkbox/gateway — authenticated player BFF

The gateway is the **only** authenticated player surface (`/api/*`). It lives on
`public_net`, validates Telegram Mini App `initData` on every request, and
composes the internal indexer / bridge / transcriber services into the
player-facing API documented in `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.

It is intentionally **not** a balance/accounting source of truth:
- canonical money/accounting → `services/bridge` + hidden chain
- canonical derived public game state → `services/indexer` (`/public/*`)
- the gateway owns only coordination state: identities, invite claims,
  registration commitments, and whisper drafts.

## Security model

- Every `/api/*` route is gated by an encapsulated `onRequest` auth hook
  (`routes/api.ts`) — there is no way to register an `/api/*` route that skips
  auth by construction.
- Telegram `initData` is verified with HMAC-SHA256 per Telegram's WebApp spec,
  plus an `auth_date` freshness window (`auth/telegram.ts`).
- The bot token is read from env/secret and **never logged**.
- No `/internal/*`, hidden RPC, orderbook, position, other-user balance, or
  signer material is ever exposed.
- Whisper raw audio / draft transcripts are private; only the *confirmed*
  transcript's hash leaves the boundary (in registration).

### Dev auth fallback

For local runs without a bot token, set `ALLOW_INSECURE_DEV_AUTH=true` and pass
`X-Dev-Telegram-Id: <id>`. This is **refused** whenever a real token is set, and
the server logs a loud warning. Never enable it in prod.
